# vigolium-scanner

Coding-agent skill for operating the [Vigolium](https://www.vigolium.com/) web
vulnerability scanner CLI. Teaches Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Pi, or any
[agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)-compatible agent how to pick the right
command, construct correct flags, triage findings, and confirm them.

## Install

The skill is embedded in the `vigolium` binary, so the installed copy always
matches your CLI version. Prefer this over copying files by hand:

```bash
vigolium skills install --agent claude --scope project   # --agent claude|codex|agents
vigolium skills                                          # list bundled skills
vigolium skills get vigolium-scanner --full              # print SKILL.md + every reference
```

| `--agent` | `--scope project` | `--scope global` |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| `claude` | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| `codex` \| `agents` | `.agents/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/` |

### Keeping it current

Each install writes `.vigolium-skill.json` beside `SKILL.md`: the skill name,
the installing binary's `binary_version` and `commit`, the `bundle_sha256`, the
sha256 of every file, and `installed_at`. Agents ignore the dotfile, and
`SKILL.md` is copied unchanged. After upgrading vigolium:

```bash
vigolium skills ls                        # state of every install location
vigolium skills install --force           # refresh one (same --agent/--scope)
vigolium doctor --fix --only skill        # refresh every stale copy in place
```

`skills ls` checks `./.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `./.agents/skills`
and `~/.agents/skills` and reports each copy as `current`, `stale` (from another
bundle, or an install that has no manifest), `modified` (a listed file was
edited or removed) or `missing`. `skills ls -j` returns the same data under
`installed`. A plain `skills install` leaves an existing copy alone and prints
`stale: run vigolium skills install --force` when it is out of date. `--force`
deletes the files the old manifest lists that the new bundle no longer ships
and keeps files you added. An install without a manifest is moved to
`<dir>.bak-<timestamp>` (its `SKILL.md` renamed to `SKILL.md.bak` so the agent
does not load it twice) before the fresh copy is written. `doctor` warns about
stale and modified copies. `doctor --fix` reinstalls only the stale ones, so
your local edits are never overwritten.

Once installed it auto-triggers on mentions of scanning, vigolium, DAST, or
vulnerability testing. In Claude Code you can also invoke it explicitly as
`/vigolium-scanner`.

Alternatives (not version-matched): `bunx skills add vigolium/skills --skill
vigolium-scanner --agent <name> --yes`, or clone
[vigolium/skills](https://github.com/vigolium/skills) and copy the folder into
`~/.claude/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/`.

```

`SKILL.md` is the only file always in context; it routes to at most one reference
per task. If you are building an agent integration, start with
`references/agent-loop.md` — it documents the `scope → plan → scan → watch →
read → confirm → mark → diff → hand off` loop, the three output channels (`-j`
document, bulk `jsonl`, live `--events` stream), the exit-code table, and the
token-bounding flags.

## Maintaining

`references/flags.generated.md` is generated — never edit it by hand:

```bash
make skill-flags          # or: vigolium skills gen-flags
```

Re-run it whenever a flag is added, renamed, or given a shorthand; the file is
committed so the embedded bundle stays self-contained.

Everything else is hand-written prose. Two rules keep it useful:

1. **Keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines.** It is loaded in full every time the
   skill triggers, so anything that belongs to one topic belongs in that topic's
   reference instead.
2. **Don't restate flags.** If `vigolium <cmd> -h` answers it, link to the
   generated reference rather than copying rows that will drift.
